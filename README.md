# Transmitter.js

Declarative data-binding JavaScript framework for web applications.
Transmitter.js helps you manage your application state, all the way from DOM to
backend storage, no matter how complex your application is.

**Transmitter.js is in early development stage and is not ready for production
yet**

There is no user facing documentation or explanation yet, if you are interested in the project, please, [write me](mailto:%6d%61%69%6c@%76%61%6c%65%6e%74%69%6e-%6e%65%6d%63%65%76.%63%6f%6d)

## TODO

### Proposed usage examples

* Canceling todo item label change
* Setting empty todo label removes todo
