# TODO

* Remove use strict (needs custom compiler for mocha, browserify and npm)

* Rename binding to connection, binder to transmitter. Name node-connnection
  object link or tie

* Better message merging (symmetrical querying and caching)

* Unit tests should describe units and their responsibilities
* Replace recursive binding with centralized in binding builder (maybe)

* Don't use context in isolated tests, use context in scenarios.
