# TODO

* Remove use strict (needs custom compiler for mocha, browserify and npm)

* Rename binding to connection, binder to transmitter.
* Better message merging (symmetrical querying and caching)

* Prioritize queries by directions

* Don't use context in isolated tests, use context in scenarios.
