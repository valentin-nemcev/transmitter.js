# TODO


## Proposed usage examples

* Button with enabled or disabled states
* Serialized value with on-demand transmission
* Select box connection
* Changing model list order preserving view state
* Adding model to list without full view refresh
* Managing list ordering with list entries
* Display some property of each model in a list with repetitions
* Two-way serialization of model list with self-references
* Two-way serialization of nested models
* View types dependent on model property
* Reusing same view with different models
* Accepting or canceling changes with intermediate models


## Development tasks

* Remove use strict (needs custom compiler for mocha, browserify and npm)

* Better message merging (symmetrical querying and caching)

* Prioritize queries by directions

* Don't use context in isolated tests, use context in scenarios.
